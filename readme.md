# Project LaVie - API for Psychologist

A group of psychologists got together and created the clinic La Vie - Mental Health that offers different types of therapy.
To help with care, they need an API that allows them to create records of psychologists, patients and medical records. In a conversation with the Front-ends and the POs, some groups of endpoints that should be created were decided.
